"""
Copy scanner implementation from your backend
You'll need to replace this with your actual working scanner code
"""

# Copy your working scanner code from backend/core/scanner.py here
# Remove the Django dependencies and keep only the scanner functionality

# Example of what to copy:
# 1. All the ctypes definitions (DPFPDD_STATUS, etc.)
# 2. The FingerprintScanner class
# 3. DLL loading logic
# 4. Function prototypes
# 5. Capture methods

# Make sure to:
# - Remove Django/database dependencies  
# - Keep only Windows/scanner functionality
# - Update DLL paths to use config.SCANNER_DLLS
# - Use the ScannerError exception defined in scanner.py
